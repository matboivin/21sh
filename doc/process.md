# Process

1. The Parser​

- Reads the command line and stores it in a Command Table structure.
- Is composed of:
  - A lexer (Lexical Analyzer​): splits the command into tokens.
  - A parser: processes the tokens according to a grammar and builds the Command Table.

2. The Executor​

- Takes the Command Table structure and creates a process for each Simple Command.
- Create pipes to communicate the output of one process to the input of the next one.
- Redirects the standard input, standard output, and standard error in case of redirections. 

3. ​Shell Subsystems

- Environment Variables: set, expand and print environment variables.
- Wildcards (bonus)
- Subshells (check if bonus)

# Steps

## Get the environment

Resource: [Gnu.org: Environment Access](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Environment-Access.html)

A linked list struct to ol the key and the value for each variable.

```c
typedef struct		s_env
{
	char			*key;
	char			*value;
	struct s_env	*next;
}					t_env;
```

Functions to:

- Add a variable (different than `setenv`)
- Delete a variable (different than `unsetenv`)
- Init the env by getting all the pairs (use the 1st function)
- Clear the env by deleting all the pairs (see `clearenv`)
- `getenv`: get the value of a variable
- `env`: print the env

## Register signal handling (basic way first)

> When Bash is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores SIGTERM (so that ‘kill 0’ does not kill an interactive shell), and SIGINT is caught and handled (so that the wait builtin is interruptible). When Bash receives a SIGINT, it breaks out of any executing loops. In all cases, Bash ignores SIGQUIT. If job control is in effect (see Job Control), Bash ignores SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.
